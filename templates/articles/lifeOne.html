        <p>Under the sun of the 21st Century, we’re growing up with each tick of the clock, but unknowingly we form perceptions about the world, people we meet and even ourselves. It has become hard to find someone who thinks more than he/she judges. We’re growing up in a very different environment as compared to the generations of one or two decades back. Kids’ toys are replaced by massive gaming curved screens or tiny little simulated virtual games on the phones or tablets or phablets. Teens are busy at schools and universities where apart from studies, new engagements consume their precious time, like social networks, love lives, unnecessary attention towards others and more. Their parents are bound in their jobs and are constantly aiming for higher and higher designations and pay checks. The grandparents, if still alive, are dumped into a separate room with a full-time caretakers to look after them, because no family member has time or patience to spend time with them, and the grandparents wait for their judgment day to fall upon, at the earliest, and in some cases, even the family is more eager for that day.</p>
        <p class = 'shlRe-mrgT3 shlRe-cursive'>Yes, we’re growing up!</p>
        <p class = 'shlRe-mrgT3'>But, in this process of growing up, are we missing anything? Are we ignoring anything? Studies, check; Work, check; Love-lives, check; Gadgets, check; Social Networking, check; TV, check;</p>
        <p class = 'shlRe-cursive'>
            Humans, have the tendency to forget things, <br>
            the instant they occur. Yes, we are indeed missing<br>
            on the fundamental grounds of our existence, that is love.
        </p>
        <p class = 'shlRe-mrgT3'>We have forgot to love each other and ourselves. Ourselves? Yes, ourselves. No one thinks about the feelings we’re inculcating into our fellow brothers and sister, sons and daughters and citizens. Do we expect them to grow-up? They will certainly grow, but will they have the loving and caring heart for all, an eye to see everyone as equal, without any barrier of caste or color or gender? How will they treat their parents when they grow-up? Or their fellow brothers and sisters, sons and daughters?</p>
        <p class = 'shlRe-cursive'>
            Yes, we need to hit the pause button for a while.
        </p>
        <p class = 'shlRe-mrgT3'>The concept of loving ourselves is so strange and uncommon that no one ever thinks about it or dismisses it as irrelevant or obscure. But, this is the key to all kinds of problems, small and large, in office or at home, everywhere. When a person starts loving himself/herself, then, he/she is dawned by the realisation that he/she is much more beautiful, powerful, able, praiseworthy, knowledgeable than what he/she thinks of himself/herself. We’re living our lives on somebody else’s terms and expectations, without giving a slightest of thought towards our motive in life. When we start loving ourselves, we start believing in ourselves, we start spreading love to the people around us, our fellow brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, start growing in love; our grandparents start spending their last breathes in happiness and we all start growing in love.</p>
        <p class = 'shlRe-cursive'>
            Then, we all together grow in love.
        </p>
        <p class = 'shlRe-mrgT3'>
            The most precious thing in this world, is that which can only be felt, within, is love. And this love is not physical but made up of some mysterious kind, which can be seen in the form of tears, in the form of sacrifices, in the form of hard work and it can only be tasted. You’re more than you think, when you are drenched in love for yourself, for your fellow beings, for your God(if you believe in one).
